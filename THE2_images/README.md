Second assignment of the image processing homework of the METU.In this assignment, I have written some MATLAB scripts to eliminate the noise and to perform edge detection in the frequency domain.All of the code that I have written and all of the numbers inside the implementation are based on the images that I have. General idea will be the same but except you might need to change the numbers by looking the correctness of your outputs.
